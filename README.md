#  Copy for Web Pages

This is a plugin for the Contacts application that allows you to click on the phone number for a contact and copy it as a string that has any funny Unicode characters and whitespace or other grouping indicators removed.

So a number like: +1 (415) 555-5555 will be put on the Clipboard as: +1415555555

This has saved me a lot of anger and frustration with web sites that don't know how to clean up their data and make your life as a user difficult. You have to install the bundle in '~/Library/Address Book Plug-Ins'

Let me know when you use it by sending me a message.
